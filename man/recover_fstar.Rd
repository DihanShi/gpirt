\arguments{
\item{seed_state}{An integer vector of length 625.}

\item{f}{A matrix of latent function values of shape n by m by h, where
n is number of respondents, m is number of items per session, and
h is number of sessions.}

\item{y}{A matrix of shape n by m by h, giving responses for n respondents
IRFs and h sessions}

\item{theta}{A matrix of shape n by h, giving initial values
for the respondent ideology parameters}

\item{thresholds}{A vector of length C+1, giving threshold vector}

\item{beta_prior_means}{A numeric matrix of with \code{ncol(data)} columns
and two rows giving the prior means for the items' linear means' intercept
and slope; by default, a matrix of zeros}

\item{beta_prior_sds}{A numeric matrix of with \code{ncol(data)} columns
and two rows giving the prior standard deviations for the items' linear
means' intercept and slope; by default, a matrix of threes}

\item{constant_IRF}{A binary indicator of whether IRFs are constant across sessions}

  \describe{
      \item{fstar}{Estimated item response functions for the items, with one
                  column per item, or \code{m} columns, and 1001 rows.
                  The first row has the probabilities of a 1 response
                  for a theta value of -5.0, the second the probability for
                  each item of a 1 response for a theta value of -4.99,
                  ..., and the last for a theta value of 5.0.}
